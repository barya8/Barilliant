# Barilliant

## Description
Barilliant is an application that was inspired by the Facebook page I created over the past two years, where I shared the stories behind songs. As part of a lesson, I decided to take the initiative and turn my Facebook page into a fully functional application.

The app provides users with a seamless and interactive experience to explore and discover the stories behind their favorite songs. It offers features such as song search, favorite songs, and user contributions to enhance the overall user experience.

## Flow
Upon launching the app, users will be directed to the authentication landing page if it is their first login. After signing up, the app opens to the main activity where users can access three main pages through the bottom navigation menu.

- Home: This page displays all songs without any filters.
- Search: Users can search for songs based on title, artist, or album name.
- Favorites: Each user has their own favorites page, where they can view and manage the songs they have marked as favorites by clicking the heart icon.

## Features
The app offers several features to enhance the user experience:

- Add Song: Users can fill out a form to add a new song, and once submitted, it will be visible to all other users.
- Edit Song: Users can edit song details by filling out the same form and retrieving the current data from the database. After submitting the changes, the updated information will be visible to all users.
- More Info: Users can access additional details about a song, including its story and comments from other users.
- Comments: Within the More Info screen, users can read and leave comments about a specific song.
- YouTube Integration: By clicking on a song's image, users can directly open the corresponding song on YouTube.
- Dark Mode and Hebrew Language Support: The app offers a dark mode interface and supports the Hebrew language for localization.
